# C - Malloc and Free

This repository contains projects that cover the use of dynamic memory allocation in C programming language using `malloc()` and `free()` functions. These projects are part of the ALX software engineering curriculum that focuses on teaching low-level concepts.
Requirements

To use this repository, you should have the following:

- Language: C
- OS: Linux
- Compiler: gcc
- Style guidelines: Betty style

## Projects


This repository contains the following projects:

## 0x0A-malloc_free

This project introduces dynamic memory allocation in C programming language using the `malloc()` and `free()` functions. The tasks include:

- Task 0: Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char
- Task 1: Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter
- Task 2: Write a function that concatenates two strings
- Task 3: Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- Task 4: Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function
- Task 5: Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program


## 0x0B-more_malloc_free

This project builds on the concepts learned in the previous project and includes more advanced dynamic memory allocation. The tasks include:

- Task 0: Write a function that allocates memory using `malloc()`
- Task 1: Write a function that concatenates two strings using `malloc()`
- Task 2: Write a function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc()` and `free()`
- Task 3: Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers
- Task 4: Write a program that adds positive numbers
