   - **Description:** Binary search with added functionality for handling duplicates.

7. **Jump Search in Singly Linked List** 🏃‍♂️
   - **File:** [105-jump_list.c](./105-jump_list/105-jump_list.c)
   - **Description:** Jump search adapted for singly linked lists.

8. **Linear Skip in Singly Linked List** ➡️
   - **File:** [106-linear_skip.c](./106-linear_skip/106-linear_skip.c)
   - **Description:** Linear skip search for efficiently searching in sorted singly linked lists.

## Time and Space Complexities 🕰️

- Detailed explanations of time and space complexities for each algorithm can be found in the [107-O](./107-O/time_space_complexities) and [108-O](./108-O/time_space_complexities) files.

## Usage

- Each algorithm has a dedicated directory containing the C file and related files.
- Test files are provided in the [Test_files](./Test_files) directory for validating the algorithms.
