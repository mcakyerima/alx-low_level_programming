# C - Preprocessor

This project covers the concept of preprocessor directives in C. Here, I practiced implementing my own macros and using include guards in header files. Below are the tasks covered in this project:

## Tasks

### [Object-like Macro](https://github.com/mcakyerima/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h)

The header file `0-object_like_macro.h` defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### [Pi](https://github.com/mcakyerima/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/1-pi.h)

The header file `1-pi.h` defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### [File name](https://github.com/mcakyerima/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/2-main.c)

The C program `2-main.c` prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.

### [Function-like macro](https://github.com/mcakyerima/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/3-function_like_macro.h)

The header file `3-function_like_macro.h` defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### [SUM](https://github.com/mcakyerima/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/4-sum.h)

The header file `4-sum.h` defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be satisfied:

- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc version 9.3.0.
- Programs and functions are compiled with gcc using flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra` and `-pedantic`.
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No global variables are used.
- No more than five functions are allowed per file.
- All heap memory must be properly freed.
- The code should not have memory leaks.
