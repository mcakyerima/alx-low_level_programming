# C - Command Line Arguments

This repository contains projects that cover the use of command line arguments in C programming language. These projects are part of the ALX software engineering curriculum that focuses on teaching low-level concepts.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you should have the following:
- Language: C
- OS: Kali GNU/Linux
- Compiler: gcc
- Style guidelines: Betty style

## Overview

This repository covers various concepts in C programming, including:

- Using command-line arguments passed to a program
- Understanding the two prototypes of the `main` function and when to use them
- Compiling functions with unused variables or parameters using `` __attribute__((unused))`` or ``(void)``

## Projects

This repository contains the following projects:

1. **Print Program Name**

   A program that prints its name. This demonstrates how to use the argv array to access the program name.

2. **Print Number of Arguments**

   A program that prints the number of arguments passed to it. This demonstrates how to use the argc parameter of the main function.

3. **Print Arguments**

   A program that prints all the arguments it receives. This demonstrates how to use the argv array to access the program arguments.

4. **Multiply Numbers**

   A program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments. This demonstrates how to use argc and argv to read program arguments and perform arithmetic operations.

5. **Add Positive Numbers**

   A program that adds a variable number of positive numbers passed as arguments. This demonstrates how to use argc and argv to read program arguments and perform arithmetic operations.

6. **Make Change**

   A program that prints the minimum number of coins required to make change for an amount of money. This demonstrates how to use argc and argv to read program arguments and solve a problem.
